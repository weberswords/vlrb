## Description (4000 characters max)

```
vlrb is video messaging for the people you love.

In a world of endless feeds and fleeting attention, vlrb offers something different: a quiet space to share real moments with the people who matter most. Think of it like passing a note to a dear friend—personal, intentional, and just for them.

HOW IT WORKS

Record a video message (we call them "vlrbs") and send it to specific people. That's it. No public feeds. No follower counts. No algorithms deciding who sees what. Just you, your people, and the moments you choose to share.

Videos live in the cloud by default, so you'll never see "Storage Full" when trying to capture something important. Download anything you want to keep forever, and let the rest gracefully expire.

DESIGNED FOR REAL CONNECTION

• Send video messages up to 5 minutes (10 minutes for Storyteller subscribers)
• Choose exactly who receives each vlrb—no accidental sharing
• Watch on your schedule with async messaging across time zones
• Add captions to make your videos accessible to everyone
• Use Picture-in-Picture to watch while you do other things (Supporter+)

PRIVACY YOU CAN TRUST

We built vlrb on a simple principle: your moments belong to you.

• End-to-end encryption protects every video
• No ads. Ever. We're funded by subscriptions, not surveillance.
• We don't sell your data or analyze your content
• No tracking across other apps
• You control how long messages stay—from 7 days to 1 year
• Delete your account and all your data anytime

This isn't just a policy. It's a promise. If we ever can't sustain this model, we'll shut vlrb down rather than compromise your privacy.

SMART STORAGE

Your phone's storage is precious. vlrb keeps videos in the cloud so you can:

• Record freely without worrying about space
• Access your vlrbs from any device
• Save the special ones to your camera roll
• Let everyday moments expire naturally

BUILT FOR EVERYONE

Accessibility isn't an afterthought at vlrb—it's foundational. We've designed every feature with inclusivity in mind, from captioning tools to thoughtful color choices.

WHO IS VLRB FOR?

• Long-distance relationships that need more than text
• Parents sharing everyday moments with family
• Friends who want to stay connected without social media noise
• Anyone seeking real connection in an age of performance

Some things are too important for a text message, too personal for a public post. vlrb gives you space to be yourself with the people who already love you for it.

## Storage & Technical

### Do vlrbs take up space on my phone?
No! Videos are stored in the cloud by default. You can clear your local storage at anytime in settings. You can download those videos again by watching them. They only use your phone storage if you explicitly choose to save them to your device.

### Can I save vlrbs permanently?
Yes! You can save any vlrb to your camera roll by tapping the download button. Creator subscribers can also set custom expiration times or keep vlrbs indefinitely in the cloud.

### What happens to expired vlrbs?
Expired vlrbs are automatically deleted from our servers and cannot be recovered. Make sure to save any vlrbs you want to keep before they expire.

### Why can't I send vlrbs?
Common issues:
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure the app has camera and microphone permissions
- Make sure you have the latest version of the app
- Try restarting the app

## Privacy & Security

### Who can see my vlrbs?
Only the specific people you send them to. vlrb does not include functionality to forward vlrbs outside the app. However, the user you send your video to could download it and send it elsewhere.

<!-- ### Are my vlrbs encrypted? -->
<!-- Yes! All vlrbs are encrypted both in transit and at rest on our servers. We cannot view your content. -->

<!-- ### Can I delete a vlrb after sending?
You can delete vlrbs from your own device, but you cannot remove them from recipients' devices if they've already viewed or saved them. -->

<!-- ### Can I block someone?
Yes. Go to Settings > Privacy > Blocked Users. Blocked users cannot send you vlrbs or see your online status. -->

## Subscriptions & Billing

### How do I upgrade to Social or Creator?
1. Go to Settings > Subscription
2. Choose your preferred plan
3. Confirm purchase through the App Store
4. Your features activate immediately

### Can I switch between subscription tiers?
Yes! You can upgrade or downgrade anytime. Changes take effect at the next billing cycle.

### How do I cancel my subscription?
Subscriptions are managed through the App Store:
1. Go to iPhone Settings > [Your Name] > Subscriptions
2. Select vlrb
3. Choose "Cancel Subscription"

### Will I lose my vlrbs if I downgrade?
No. Your existing vlrbs remain accessible. You'll only lose access to premium features for new vlrbs.

## Features

### What is "Live Now"?
When you start recording a vlrb, your selected recipients get a notification that you're recording live. They can watch in real-time as you create your message. (Social and Creator only)

### What is Picture-in-Picture?
Creator subscribers can continue watching vlrbs while using other apps. The video plays in a small, movable window. (iOS 14+ required)

### Can I send vlrbs to multiple people?
Yes! You can select multiple recipients when sending. Each person receives their own copy and cannot see who else received it.

Currently, you can add captions. Filters and effects are on our roadmap for future updates.
